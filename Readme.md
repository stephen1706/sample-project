- what was your assumptions and design considerations when doing the exercise
    No specific assumptions were made actually.
    The design of the code is using MVVM pattern
    Unit test can be done by mocking the repository class and we can unit test the logic of the view model class

- what did you find most difficult
    I encounter a lot of data binding compiler issue during the development which take times to do the troubleshooting

- any other comments you would like to tell us
